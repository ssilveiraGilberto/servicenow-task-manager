# 🛠️ ServiceNow Task Manager (Beginner App)

This is a beginner-level ServiceNow app I built using my Personal Developer Instance (PDI), as part of my journey to become a certified ServiceNow Developer.

The app was built from scratch using the App Engine Studio to manage internal tasks and learn core platform features.
